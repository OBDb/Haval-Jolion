## Generations

The Haval Jolion is a compact crossover SUV that has gone through one main generation with a facelift:

- **First Generation (2020-2024)**: The Haval Jolion debuted at the 2020 Beijing Auto Show as a successor to the Haval H2. Production began in December 2020, with export market sales starting in 2021. Built on GWM's L.E.M.O.N. platform, the Jolion featured a 1.5L turbocharged petrol engine producing 110 kW (150 hp) and 220 Nm of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and front-wheel drive. The interior included a 12.3-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay, 7-inch instrument display, synthetic leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, and wireless phone charging. A hybrid variant was introduced in November 2021, featuring a 1.5L petrol engine combined with an electric motor for a combined output of 140 kW (188 hp) and 375 Nm of torque with a dedicated hybrid transmission (DHT).

- **First Generation Facelift (2024-present)**: The facelifted Jolion received notable styling updates including a redesigned front grille, revised front and rear bumpers, new alloy wheel designs, grey side mirror caps, updated tail-light internals, and GWM badging on the tailgate. The turbocharged petrol engine output was adjusted to 105 kW (141 hp) and 210 Nm of torque. The hybrid variant continued with the same 140 kW combined output. A sportier variant called the Jolion Pro (based on the Haval Chitu) was introduced in some markets in 2024, featuring more aggressive styling and available with both petrol and hybrid powertrains.
